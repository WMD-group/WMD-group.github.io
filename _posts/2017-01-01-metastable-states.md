We are exploring the control of function and properties of materials away from equilibrium using a combination of external stimuli. 
Applications include solid-state sensors and switches, including next-generation molecular ferroelectric compounds.
Our research into metastable materials is supported by the [Philip Leverhulme Prize in Chemistry](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/funding/grant-schemes/philip-leverhulme-prizes), as well as the 
EPSRC [M<sup>4</sup>](http://www.metastable-materials.org.uk) project.

## Optical stimuli
including single-crystal phase transitions due to linkage isomerism.

## Thermal stimuli
involving displacive instabilities, including highly anharmonic systems where there exists large differences between local and average structures.

## Electrical stimuli
including both conventional ferroelectrics, with macroscopic polarisation, to systems that exhibit microscopic polarisation domains that respond to an applied electric field. 

## Kinetic control
covering crystal engineering into new polymorphs, as well as the fabrication of 
artificial heterostructures and material composites.
