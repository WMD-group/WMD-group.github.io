title: Navigating Materials Space with Computers 
---

We are an academic group at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk) focused on the design and optimisation of advanced materials using high-performance computing. Our research on computational materials chemistry combines quantum mechanics with data-driven machine learning and multi-scale modelling approaches. The group is led by [Professor Aron Walsh](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.walsh) in the [Thomas Young Centre for the Theory & Simulation of Molecules & Materials](https://thomasyoungcentre.org) and the [Centre for Processable Electronics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/processable-electronics/).

# Open Positions

* PhD studentship in the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Next Generation Synthesis & Reaction Technology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/next-generation-synthesis-reaction-technology/how-to-apply/available-projects/) on "Data-driven spectroelectrochemistry for water oxidation electrocatalysis" to start in October 2023.

# Research Themes

## Fundamentals
* Inverse design of materials with predetermined properties 
* Crystal thermodynamics and phase transformations
* Ion, electron, and phonon transport in the solid state

## Applications
* Crystal engineering for clean energy technologies
* Photochemistry of solar cells 
* Electrochemical energy storage and fuel production 

## Materials
* Metal halide perovskites (e.g. CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>, Cs<sub>3</sub>Bi<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>9</sub>)
* Multi-component chalcogenides (e.g. Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub>, CuBiS<sub>2</sub>)
* Electroactive metal-organic frameworks (e.g. Fe<sub>2</sub>(DSBDC), Cu<sub>3</sub>(HHTP)<sub>2</sub>)
