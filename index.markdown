title: Computer-Accelerated Design of Functional Materials
---

We are a research group at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/materials) working at the intersection of quantum chemistry, machine learning, and materials science. We use high-performance computing to design and optimise materials from first principles to function. Our work spans atomistic simulations, data-driven modelling, and multi-scale theory. The group is led by [Professor Aron Walsh](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.walsh) and is part of the [Thomas Young Centre](https://thomasyoungcentre.org) and the [Centre for Processable Electronics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/processable-electronics).

# Open Positions

* For postdoctoral candidates, the next call for [Newton International Fellowships](https://royalsociety.org/grants/newton-international) will be in early 2026.

* For PhD candidates, the best time to get in touch with your CV and motivation is in October-December for admission in the following academic year. 

# Research Themes

## Fundamentals
* Inverse materials design with artificial intelligence  
* Thermodynamics and phase transitions in crystals  
* Ion, electron, and phonon transport in solids  

## Applications
* Crystal engineering for clean energy  
* Lightâ€“matter interactions in solar cells  
* Electrochemical systems for energy storage and conversion  

## Materials
* Metal halide perovskites (e.g. CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>, Cs<sub>3</sub>Bi<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>9</sub>)
* Multi-component chalcogenide semiconductors (e.g. Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub>, AgBiS<sub>2</sub>)
* Electroactive metal-organic frameworks (e.g. Fe<sub>2</sub>(DSBDC), Cu<sub>3</sub>(HHTP)<sub>2</sub>)
