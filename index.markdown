title: Navigating Chemical Space with Computers 
---

We are an academic research group focused on the design and optimisation of crystals using high-performance computing. Our work on computational materials chemistry combines quantum mechanics with data-driven machine learning and multi-scale modelling approaches.  The group is led by [Professor Aron Walsh](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.walsh) at Imperial College London.
