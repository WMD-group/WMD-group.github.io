title: Navigating Materials Space with Computers 
---

We are an academic group at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk) focused on the design and optimisation of advanced materials using high-performance computing. Our research on computational materials chemistry combines quantum mechanics with data-driven machine learning and multi-scale modelling approaches. The group is led by [Professor Aron Walsh](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.walsh) in the [Thomas Young Centre for the Theory & Simulation of Molecules & Materials](https://thomasyoungcentre.org) and the [Centre for Processable Electronics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/processable-electronics/).
