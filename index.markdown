title: Navigating Chemical Space with Computers 
---

We are an academic research group focused on the design and optimisation of crystals using high-performance computing. Our work on computational materials chemistry combines quantum mechanics with data-driven machine learning and multi-scale modelling approaches.  The group is led by [Professor Aron Walsh](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.walsh) at Imperial College London.

# Research Themes

## Fundamentals
* Inverse design of crystals with predetermined properties 
* Solid-state thermodynamics and transformations
* Ion, electron, and phonon transport in semiconductors 

## Applications
* Crystal engineering for clean energy technologies
* Non-radiative losses in solar cells 
* Electrochemical energy storage and fuel production 

## Materials
* Metal halide perovskites (e.g. CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>, Cs<sub>3</sub>Bi<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>9</sub>)
* Multi-component chalcogenides (e.g. Cu<sub>2</sub>ZnSnS<sub>4</sub>, CuBiS<sub>2</sub>)
* Metal-organic frameworks (e.g. Fe<sub>2</sub>(DSBDC), Cu<sub>3</sub>(HHTP)<sub>2</sub>)
