### Recent Highlights 

* We contributed to [Best practices in machine learning for chemistry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-021-00716-z) in Nature Chemistry, which aims to increase reproducability and reliability for models published in the field. 

* Aron has joined [JACS](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jacsat) as an Associate Editor covering energy materials and machine learning. 

* A global consensus on [perovskite solar cell stability protocols](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-019-0529-5) was published in Nature Energy. Credit goes to Monica Lira-Cantu for leading the highly-collaborative effort.

* To track advances in the latest photovoltaic technologies, we have been involved in the setup of the "Emerging inorganic solar cell efficiency tables" as a new series in J Phys. Energy as [V1](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7655/ab2338) and [V2](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7655/abebca/meta).

* Aron contributed to [Charting a course for chemistry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-019-0236-7) in Nature Chemistry to celebrate their 10th anniversary and future directions in the field.

* We made our third appearance in the [Highly Cited Researchers](https://recognition.webofscience.com/awards/highly-cited/2020/) list.
